# Day 1

## My First Journal Post

Today I found out that I can publish a blog without having to pay for hosting for domain using gitbook. I have spent many hours researching on how to making my own blog so that I can publish my work, writeups, project so that I can use it as my portfolio. Looking for best hosting, domain, other alternative, and all of those cost  money, and for someone who is broke like me, is not an option. And luckily somehow I saw on reddit post that talk about gitbook and I knowing it free I just dive in and try and error. I can't wait to learn and share more knowledge. Stay tune guys <3

## Why I Journal

Journaling for me is a way for me too look back and see how far have I come, and appreciate all the efforts that took me to become someone I wanted to be and by making it a public journal might inspire people to keep on pursuing the things that they love. Before I was badly demotivated that I almost gave up pursuing CyberSecurity because of how hard it was, I was overwhelmed by all the new input that I have to receive and I felt like I wasn't cut for it. Then I realized that everyone journey is different, It might be hard now, but it will bear fruit one day. I believe that with hardship come ease.

> #### “For indeed, with hardship \[will be] ease…Indeed, with hardship \[will be] ease…So when you have finished \[your duties], then stand up \[for worship]. And to your Lord direct \[your] longing.” (Quran, 94:5-8)

So guys keep on grinding ! keep on going ! We Can Do it !
